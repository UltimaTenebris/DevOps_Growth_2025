Requirements from "BeStrong" Client (It's fictional company, this requirements used to practice only)

Hi! We finally got our funding. I'll try to explain what we need — apologies in advance if something is unclear, I'm more of a business person than an infrastructure guy.
    1. Where our code will live — we need something to run our backend. We don't want VMs — too much hassle with updates and security. We want something managed where we just deploy our code and it works. Also important: we want this thing to "introduce itself" to other Azure services without passwords. And it should sit inside our private network, not be exposed to the outside more than necessary. 
    2. See what's happening — when something crashes, we want to know why. Logs, charts, errors — all in one place. It should be somehow connected to where our code runs. 
    3. Where to put our containers — we package our app in Docker. We need a private "warehouse" for these images somewhere in Azure. And only our application should be able to pull from it. 
    4. Safe for passwords — all kinds of API keys, database passwords, tokens — we don't want to keep them in code or configs. We need something specialized for secrets. Access only for our application, and this safe shouldn't be exposed to the public internet. 
    5. Our private territory — we want all of this to live in an isolated network. Like our own little data center in the cloud. 
    6. Where to store data — we'll have lots of structured data: users, orders, transactions. We need a proper database that our developers know how to work with (they know SQL Server). Connection — only from inside our network, no public endpoints. 
    7. For user files — people will upload documents, photos. We need somewhere to store this. Also private, through our network. And our application should see it as a regular folder with files. 
    8. For your Terraform magic — our previous consultant said that infrastructure state shouldn't be kept on a laptop. Set up something so it's stored reliably in the cloud.
